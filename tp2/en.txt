Article 13 approved: What is the EU copyright law amendment?

Critics of Article 13, the proposed EU directive on copyright, warned that it could censor internet users

Politics

In September the European Parliament voted on - and approved - an amended version of the EU copyright law that was rejected by the same body in July of this year.

The divisive legislation was put to the ultimate democratic test in Strasbourg, with 438 voting in favour of the measures, 226 voting against and 39 abstaining. 

The proposed changes have split opinions, with proponents of reform including many notable musicians and artists, such as Wyclef Jean, who made an appearance in Strasbourg today. Opponents of the legislation include websites and internet presences who claim the laws will mark the end of "meme" culture and user-generated content. 

As for the immediate future, nothing's going to change yet. State leaders within the EU still need to sanction the changes before individual countries start hashing out the legal minutiae of the change. 

A particular point of contention is Article 13, which, were it to come to fruition, would make platforms like YouTube liable for copyrighted material. As such, platforms would require agreements with content producers (or whoever owns the rights to the music, film or television being shared).

YouTube has taken a particularly vocal stance against the proposed change, with the firm's CEO Susan Wojcicki taking to Twitter to voice her stance: "Article 13 could put the creative economy of creators and artists around the world at risk," she propounded.
