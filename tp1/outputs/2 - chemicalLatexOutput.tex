\textbf{What Are Elements and Compounds?}



\textit{Abstract}

The definitions of elements and compounds have changed very little in the past 200 years, but chemistry itself has changed a great deal over time. Any form of an element has been considered as the element itself and a compound had to have an exact atomic composition that included two or more different elements. This commentary suggests that only the atomic form of each element should be considered as the element and most other forms should be called elementary substances. A publication of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has stated that compounds can be formed by a single element. The author agrees that in terms of modern chemical bonding both heteronuclear and homonuclear molecules can be considered as compounds.



\textit{Article}

This question was brought to my attention by an article(1) in this Journal entitled: “A2: Element or Compound?” This article shows the result of quizzes given to students and the correct response according to the authors is that the gas A2 is an element. \scalebox{0.3}{

} a common textbook,(2) these definitions are found in the glossary under element: “(1) A substance which cannot be separated into simpler components by using chemical techniques. (2) A substance consisting of atoms of the same atomic number. Examples: hydrogen; gold; uranium.” Also in the same textbook a compound is described as “...an electrically neutral substance that consists of two or more different elements with their atoms present in a definite ratio.” Versions similar to this can be found in most of the textbooks that \scalebox{0.3}{

} could find. It seems that these definitions have been in use for over 150 years. The first definition under elements is commonly attributed to Lavoisier. Surely our definition of chemical techniques has changed a great deal since then. The purpose of this commentary is to initiate a reconsideration as to how, in the 21st century, should we define elements and compounds?

Two recent Nobel Prizes have been given for the preparation of substances that this definition would simply call elements. A Chemistry Prize was given for the isolation of the interesting molecule C60\footlabel{C60}{This formula has the IUPAC name \textbf{(C{60}-I{h})[5,6]fullerene} and the molecular formula \textbf{C60}. Some alternative names are Fullerene, Fullerene C60, Buckminsterfullerene and 99685-96-8. Its complexity has value 2030. The exact mass is 720. The molecular weight is 720.66. The monoisotopic mass is 720. }, and the most recent Physics Prize was given for obtaining graphene from graphite. Both these new forms of carbon have chemical bonding that gives them very interesting physical and chemical properties. Should we dismiss them as simply elements or even allotropes? \scalebox{0.3}{

} the case of oxygen, we also have the very important molecule, ozone. It is formed in the upper atmosphere and it protects all living things from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light from the sun. Ozone is a triatomic molecule with a well-defined molecular structure, it has an electric dipole moment, and it is closely related to both sulfur dioxide and disulfur monoxide.

The concept of an element is very old and \scalebox{0.3}{

  \end{tikzpicture}}
}. A. Paneth’s article(3) entitled, “The Epistemological Status of the Chemical Concept of Element”, traces it back to Aristotle. Our thinking is very physical and is based on modern physics and astronomy. Data in these fields tell us that all the matter on our earth was generated by complicated and violent nuclear events that created our atomic nuclei. These nuclei are the components of ordinary matter and they form the chemical elements. The first list of chemical elements came from classical analytical chemistry. The periodic table introduced systematics for these elements, and every textbook gives this table a prominent place. Our understanding of the nature of the elements shown in the periodic table has changed over the years. Analytical chemists knew nothing of atoms, nuclei, and electrons, and so any form of each element was taken as the element itself. One hundred years ago, we discovered that each chemical element possesses a nucleus that had a unique positive charge and is surrounded by electrons, which fill most of the volume of the element. Soon we learned about the s, p, d, and f orbitals and about the energies of the electrons in these orbitals. With this understanding, the reasons for the strange periodicity of the periodic table became clear. It was then seen that each chemical element was a unique atom and the common forms of the elements are the result of these atoms bonding together.

We have now learned how to generate and study atoms, and the atoms in the periodic table can be directly used to do chemistry. We can ask what form of each element are we listing in this table? For the symbol in the periodic table “\scalebox{0.3}{
  \centerfigure{\begin{tikzpicture}[font=\sffamily, transform shape]

  \end{tikzpicture}}
}”, do we mean graphite, diamond, or even C60\footref{C60}? The chemistry of each of these forms is different, but the position in the table is established by the charge on the nucleus of the atom and the bonding properties of its electrons. \scalebox{0.3}{

} Linus Pauling’s College Chemistry,(4) he stated: “The kind of matter represented by a particular kind of atom is called an element.” This is followed by: “All pure substances can be divided into two classes: elementary substances and compounds.” J. E. Early’s recent article(5) goes over many of the historical aspects of elements and substances mentioned by Paneth,(3) but he does take the position that H2\footlabel{H2}{This formula has the IUPAC name \textbf{molecular hydrogen} and the molecular formula \textbf{H2}. Some alternative names are Hydrogen, Dihydrogen, Molecular hydrogen and 1333-74-0. The exact mass is 2.016. The molecular weight is 2.016. The monoisotopic mass is 2.016. } and O2\footlabel{O2}{This formula has the IUPAC name \textbf{molecular oxygen} and the molecular formula \textbf{O2}. Some alternative names are Oxygen, Molecular oxygen, oxygen molecule and Dioxygen. The exact mass is 31.99. The molecular weight is 31.998. The monoisotopic mass is 31.99. } should be called an “elementary substance” and not the element itself.

} this analysis, once one had reached the point of identifying the amounts and number of elements present in a sample, the analysis ceased, for that is as far as simple chemical analysis could go. Compounds were identified if they satisfied the laws of definite proportions, multiple proportions, and equivalent proportions, even when most of the compounds examined at that time were not very pure.(6) \scalebox{0.3}{

} 1860, as part of the finalization of the atomic weight scale, it was decided that the common elemental gases, which were known at that time, were all diatomic molecules. They were still called elements and not compounds, despite being diatomic, for that is what chemical analysis concluded. \scalebox{0.3}{

} the 20th century we developed X-ray crystallography, molecular spectroscopy, and quantum mechanical methods to determine molecular structure, and we can even calculate the properties of chemical bonds. We learned that the difference between diamond and graphite is the nature of their chemical bonds. Discussion of chemical bonding has become an important part of chemistry. For example, when we discuss chemical bonding, molecular nitrogen, N2\footlabel{N2}{This formula has the IUPAC name \textbf{molecular nitrogen} and the molecular formula \textbf{N2}. Some alternative names are Nitrogen, Nitrogen gas, Molecular nitrogen and 7727-37-9. Its complexity has value 8. The exact mass is 28.006. The molecular weight is 28.014.

}. The gases in our atmosphere are commonly called oxygen and nitrogen, but their modern names(7) are dioxygen and dinitrogen.

One can try to look past current textbooks for a more modern definition of a compound, and a colleague suggested the publications of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The authors make recommendations in their publications for all sorts of chemical matters. If one looks in the IUPAC booklet,(8) “Principles of Chemical Nomenclature”, there is first a discussion of the elements in the periodic table and their symbols. Next is a discussion of substances and compounds. A key statement in this discussion is: “Compounds are composed of atoms of the same or more than one kind of element in some form of chemical combination.” A little later they also state: “An elementary substance is a physical form of that element, as it may be prepared and studied.”

The IUPAC definition of compounds is very broad, and it also seems to take issue with the concept that a compound has to have an exact whole number chemical formula. The modern high temperature \scalebox{0.3}{

It is clear that chemistry teachers should stay away from exam questions about elements and compounds for the correct answers are uncertain, but what should we now suggest to textbook authors? The first message is that it is time to consider the old definitions as purely historical. Chemistry has gotten very complex over the last 50 years and the textbook authors have to simplify, but the classical definitions of elements and compounds are too out-of-date for what we now know about chemistry. Above all, the designation of element should be reserved for the atoms themselves, and for the common forms of the elements, the designation of elementary substances should be used. For the designation as compounds it is not clear what most authors will do. One approach is just to forget the historical definition and follow the approach given by IUPAC, but for some teachers schooled in the old ways that might be too much. We know that all molecules are unique, held together by the same kinds of chemical bonds regardless of whether the nuclei are identical or not. \scalebox{0.3}{
  \centerfigure{\begin{tikzpicture}[font=\sffamily, transform shape]

  \end{tikzpicture}}
} a compromise, we offer the following designations: chemical substances and elementary substances. Chemical substances are compounds if they have formula weights that are not simply atomic weights. It seems logical that all molecules should be called compounds. This would mean that dinitrogen, ozone, and C60\footref{C60}, which have their unique formula weights, could be called compounds, but metallic gold or graphite, which have no unique formula weight, should be called elementary substances. \scalebox{0.3}{

  \end{tikzpicture}}
} the same time, some authors might be more radical and say that all substances held together by chemical bonds are compounds. We could even invent the term elementary compound, but that would seem to be unnecessary. We should also give up the idea that chemistry is devoted entirely to making pure compounds. Many of the most important substances these days are prepared not to be pure and can be called materials or doped compounds.





\textbf{Chemical Elements}



\textit{Their Classfication}



THE recognition of certain properties, the association of certain ideals with the several elements, is a necessary step in classifying the elements in accordance with MendeleJeff's great generalization—or rather it may be said to be both involved in and an outcome of Mendelejeff's conception. Until recently our difficulty was to understand the relationship of the metallic and the non-metallic elements; now we are confronted with another problem — that of the existence of inert “paraffinoid” elements. 

It is commonly assumed that these are monatomic, but the evidence on which this assumption is based is absolutely unconvincing, and would be generally admitted to be so were we in the habit of looking before we leapt to conclusions. Assuming that the elements are compounds, the formation of inert compounds does not appear to be out of place, in view of the existence of practically inert hydrocarbons. But, on the other hand, in view of the properties of nitrogen, which is one of the most active of substances in the monatomic state, although an inert gas in the diatomic condition, it may well be that the inertness of helium and the other a member of the argon group is also simulated. 

Sir James Dewar's; observations have shown that helium and charcoal have no inconsiderable affinity at the toiling point of the former, which is within five • degrees of the absolute zero, the molecular heat of absorption (apart from that due to liquefaction) of helium at that temperature being apparently as high as about sixty calories. The proof he has also given that helium alone does not convey an electric discharge is also of significance since the pas- Rage of a discharge through it under ordinary conditions is an indication that it can be included with ether substances in a conducting system. Such evidence as there is therefore points to the elements under discussion being different from the others only in the degree of stability of their molecules. 

Of late years the difficulty of classifying the elements has been increased rather than diminished, not merely because of the discovery of the inert gases but also on account of the apparent impossibility of ordering the position of an element such as tellurium in accordance with its atomic weight. There appears to '\scalebox{0.3}{

}\footlabel{Be}{This formula has the IUPAC name \textbf{beryllium} and the molecular formula \textbf{Be}. Some alternative names are Beryllium, 7440-41-7, Beryllium metal and Beryllium metallic. The exact mass is 9.012. The molecular weight is 9.012. The monoisotopic mass is 9.012. } little room left for doubt that the value cannot be far removed from that of iodine; it should be considerably lower. It may be pointed out that the accepted value of selenium is closer to that of bromine than would be expected if a relationship were maintained corresponding to that between chlorine and sulphur. It would seem that Mendelejeff's original conception of the elements as a simple series in which the properties are periodic functions of the atomic weights must be abandoned in favor of some more comprehensive scheme. 

From the chemist's point of view, it is impossible to abandon the guiding principle underlying the arrangement in family groups, which dates back to Dumas; perhaps insufficient attention has been paid in the past to the maintenance of this principle. Taking into account this principle, it is impossible to arrange a long series of elements such as the rare earths continuously in order of atomic weight, as they would be brought into every family in the- table by such a procedure; the difficulty has been got over by Brauner, who has proposed to arrange a large number of the rare earths in a single vertical series under barium. 

Bilitz has made a similar proposal. The principle had been advocated by me previously in an article written • for the Encyclopedia Britannica. \scalebox{0.3}{

} have proposed, it is not only assumed that there may be as many as sixteen vertical series of elements of which the elements from hydrogen to oxygen are initial terms, some series being at present unrepresented, it is also suggested that groups of elements occur in perhaps four of these series, numbers 4, 8, 12, and 16, the largest being that of the so- called rare earths in series 8. The principle which is assumed to be in operation is that which is so clearly manifest in the case of hydrocarbons: successive vertical series of elements correspond to successive isologous series of homologous hydrocarbons.

}, which is not an immediate derivative of benzene but of butlebenzene. It is conceivable that at the genesis of the elements a process was at work corresponding to that by which a hydrocarbon such as naphthalene is derived from benzene, and by which the former then serves in turn as the point of departure for more complex hydrocarbons of other series. 

There is no reason, from this point of view, why progression should not take place along a particular line and that terms should exist in a series through which this line passes but below it—for example, that antimony and iodine may bear a direct linear relationship, but that tellurium, instead of being the element in the progression series in the oxygen group, is a homologue of greater weight. The same view may be taken of selenium. \scalebox{0.3}{

} this way, it would be possible to> maintain selenium and tellurium in. the oxygen-sulphur series, from which they cannot well be separated, while retaining Mendelejeff's conception of a genetic relationship along the series. 

The only departure involved is in assuming that instead of forming a single linear series ascending regularly in spiral progression—a series which can, as it were, be strung- on a single spirally-wound cord—the elements closely simulate a series of homologous isoi!ogous hydrocarbons. From this point of view, it is easy also to understand that some vertical series are unrepresented.

} have already referred to the manner in which it is exemplified by silica. The greatest advance in the discussion of the problems of valency in recent years is that made by Barlow and Pope, as their method of treatment is one which applies to solid substances—the correlation of structure with crystalline form which it affects promises to be of far-reaching importance. 

Apart from hydrogen, carbon is the one element of certain character, always acting as a tetrad—its affinities may be only incompletely satisfied but they are always exercised, it may be supposed, even in ethe- noid and similar compounds; carbon monoxide apparently is the only exception to this rule, its relative inactivity being one of the most puzzling enigmas of our science, especially as the oxide becomes one of the most active of known substances when only two atoms of hydrogen are added to it. Most other elements (non-metallic) seem to vary in valency, the valency beyond a certain minimum being dependent on the nature of the association. Of late years, attention has been directed in particular to the quadrival- ency of oxygen in many of its compounds. 

The quadrivalency of sulphur in substances such as trimethylsulpnoni.Im iodide, Me3SI, having been proved to demonstration by the production of optically active compounds of this type (Pope and Peachey), it can no longer be supposed that in such cases we are dealing with compounds in which the negative constituents of the parent molecules are conjoined, e. g., Mel: SMe2- And yet we must contemplate the existence of such compounds as possible—in the case of nitrogen, for example, as ammonia must be supposed to form the compound \scalebox{0.3}{

}. The existence of such differences affords clear proof in the case of the non-metallic elements other than carbon that valency is not merely a variable but also a reciprocal or dependent function. 

There is no reason to suppose that hydrogen ever acts otherwise than as a simple monad; and the behavior of the alkalies and alkaline earths in salts would seem to justify the conclusion that they have no tendency to vary in valency, were it not for the existence of well-defined non-volatile hydrides of these metals which are clearly substances of some degree of molecular complexity. Such compounds are illustrations of the difficulties which surround the subject. 

It has long been clear that the exhibition of the higher valency by an element is a process of a different order from that manifest when it exerts only its lower proper valency measured in terms of positive radicles such as \scalebox{0.3}{

} this and many other instances, it suffices to assume that the chlorine and oxygen atoms are united in a closed ring, the chlorine functioning as a triad. 

Some such explanation will doubtless be given of the structure of the metallic ammonias and similar compounds. The co-ordination values introduced by Werner serve only to establish certain empirical relationships and are useful for the purposes- of classification. 

The perhaps more rational plan of dealing with such compounds suggested by A begg has a similar value. It is to the advantage of the hypothesis formulated by Barlow and Pope that the elements are represented as of constant valency in so far as their relative volume spheres of influence are concerned—the compound in which the higher valency is manifest being derived from that of lower valency by the opening out of the close packed arrangement and the insertion of certain new elements; but the fact that in such cases the volume is altered not in one direction alone in the crystalline structure but proportionately in all directions would seem to show that the volume sphere of atomic influence does actually change; the change is one, however, which affects all the atoms in the complex proportionately. \scalebox{0.3}{

} present, unfortunately, our methods of treating the problems of valency are such that we cannot in any way give expression to the energy side of the phenomena. 

Of late there has been talk of electrons in this connection, but what is said is little more than superficial paraphrase, in the advanced scientific slang of the day, of the ideas which have long been current: When, following Odling, we represent valency by dashes written after the elementary symbol, we give clear expression by means of a simple convention to certain ideas that are well understood by all among us who are versed in the facts; to speak of electrons and use dots instead of dashes may serve to mislead the unwary, who hang on the lips of authority, into a belief that we have arrived at an explanation of the phenomena, but those who. 

Known that we have reached only the let-it-be-granted stages and who feel that the electron is possibly but a figment of the imagination will remain satisfied with a symbolic system which has served us so long and so well as a means of giving simple expression to facts which we do not pretend to explain. 

Not a few of us who listened to the discussion of the nature of the atom at Leicester could not but feel that the physicists knew nothing of its structure and were wildly waving hands in the air in the endeavor to grasp at an interpretation which would permit of mathematical interpretation being given to the facts. Until the credentials of the electron are placed on a higher plane of practical politics, until they are placed on a practical plane,,we may well rest content with our present condition and admit frankly that our knowledge is insufficient to enable us even to venture on an explanation of valency.

} my opinion the experimental evidence is in no way satisfactory. It appears to me to be desirable that in studying the phenomena of electric discharge in gases and especially in vapors of complex substances, the horrible pitfalls should be taken into account with which the field of work is studded; unless every precaution to secure purity—precautions such as Baker and Dewar have taught us to use—be taken at every step, the conclusions based on all such observations must be open to grave doubt.
